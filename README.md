# Text-Mining-US-News

The aim of this project is to investigate the trend in the US news throughout the last 5 years. In particular, we focus on the entities appeared in the news each month and which topics were trending. In addition, where did the most important events take place and how can the news topics be represented with named entities are part of the research questions. Furthermore, an analysis of the sentiment in the news throughout the 5 years was conducted to see how different events affected the overall morale of people. We expect to see people like Trump heading the news in 2016 and find France and World Cup heading the news in mid 2018 and of course, see how the number of mentions for China and Wuhan will explode in 2020.
Our project consists of 3 main Text-mining operations: Named Entity Recog- nition (NER), Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling. In a separate section, each component will be discussed about how it was implemented, evaluated, what were the limitations. Furthermore, The visuals that were extracted from each component are shown alongside the insights that can be found in them.
